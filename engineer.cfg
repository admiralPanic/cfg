//*ENGIE SCRPIT*
//*STARTS HERE**


//Very fast build/destroy/move/upgrade script for the Engineer
//by Fede-lasse, with help from Icehawk, vincister, Metroid48, and [HvC]Terr

//Controls:
//Build and destroy with F1-4. After you've placed a building, keep holding the
//left mouse button to immediately speed up building time. Hold the right mouse 
//button to upgrade. Press the middle mouse button to pick up (move) a building.
//Press F to enable/disable these binds. When disabled, you can instantly rocket
//jump using the middle mouse button.

//Description:
//This script makes it fast to place and upgrade buildings by using the F1-4 buttons
//to bring up any building, and thereafter allow you to start hammer away without
//having to switch to wrench after placement. For further quick upgrades after
//placement, an auto-upgrade feature has been incorporated into the right mouse
//button. You can quickly pick up your buildings by pressing the middle mouse
//button. This makes stuff like Mini-Sentries deadly. Press F to toggle between
//the old and new binds.

//As a bonus, there's a "power jump" implemented into the
//middle mousebutton when you disable these Engineer binds, which makes it much
//eaiser to rocket jump or use the Force-a-Nature to fly around the place.

//Tip 1: Press F1-4 quickly to remove buildings before the enemy can destroy your
//       buildings before or after countdown reaches zero.
//Tip 2: If lag somehow causes you to repeatedly shoot, then press 1 to restart
//       the key binds.
//Tip 3: Use F1 to build a sentry outside your spawn, then pick it up using the
//       middle mouse button and move it to the frontlines.
//Tip 4: If you use the Gunslinger, then you can play hide-and-seek with the enemy
//       by constantly building, moving, and placing a Mini-Sentry to the annoyance
//       of the enemy. They'll eventually become so hurt that you or your teammates
//       will be able to take them down.

//Fixed upgrade by vincister
